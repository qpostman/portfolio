        <p class = "intro"> 
            I am junior at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, majoring in Magazine, News and Digital Journalism.
            As a Digital Editor for Syracuse's nonprofit, student-run newspaper <strong>The Daily Orange</strong> I help manage our digital content. My responsibilties include pitching graphics, headlines, tweets and running the D.O. Sports <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dailyorangesports/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DOsports" target="_blank">X</a> accounts, in addition to writing for the paper's well-regarded sports section. I've also gained freelance experience as a journalist for The Bergen Record.
